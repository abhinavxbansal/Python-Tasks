# Assignment â€“ File Handling in Python

## Files
1. `Read_file_task1.py`  
   - Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.  
   - Prints its content line by line.  
   - Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.  

2. `appendfile_task2.py`  
   - Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.  
   - Appends additional data to the same file.  
   - Reads and displays the final content of the file.
